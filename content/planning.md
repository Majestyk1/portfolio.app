# Project Planning

## Goals
- **Showcase my skills:** Present a clean, modern portfolio site highlighting expertise in React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. The site will clearly showcase key projects (Green Findr, HVAC Service Portal, RememberMe AI) and demonstrate problem-solving skills.  
- **User-Centric Design:** Build a responsive, accessible dark-themed SPA with smooth navigation and polished micro-animations. Focus on readability and inclusivity (good contrast, keyboard navigation, etc.) to accommodate all users.  
- **Timely Launch:** Complete the project within a 1–2 week timeline, leveraging familiar technologies to deliver a professional site on schedule. This includes planning, development, testing, and deployment phases with realistic milestones.  

## Constraints
- **Time-Sensitive:** Must be functional and presentable within 14 days to support job applications. 
- **Solo Build:** All design, code, and content will be handled independently, requiring smart scope decisions. 
- **Resource-Aware:** Use only free-tier hosting, libraries, and tools unless absolutely necessary. 
- **Familiar Stack Only:** Stick with React, Tailwind, Firebase — avoid deep rabbit holes with unfamiliar tools. 

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (with Vite), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for animations)  
- **Backend/Services:** Firebase Hosting, Firestore, Firebase Auth (if needed)  
- **Deployment:** Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting (final choice TBD)  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub (with main branch deploy hook)  
- **Design Tools:** Figma for layout mockups and previews
