# Project Planning

## Goals
- **Showcase my skills:** Present a clean, modern portfolio site highlighting my experience Frontend: React.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, Webpack, Figma, Backend: Node.js, MongoDB, Nginx, PM2, Certbot, Development Tools: Git, GitHub, Bash, Prettier, ESLint, Postman, Jest. The site will clearly showcase key projects (Green Findr, airdoctor-refactor, WTWR) and demonstrate problem-solving skills.

- **User-Centric Design:** Build a responsive, accessible dark-themed SPA with smooth navigation and polished micro-animations. Focus on readability and inclusivity (good contrast, keyboard navigation, etc.) to accommodate all users.   

## Constraints
- **Time-Sensitive:** Must be functional and presentable within 14 days to support job applications. 
- **Solo Build:** All design, code, and content will be handled independently, requiring smart scope decisions. 
- **Resource-Aware:** Use only free-tier hosting, libraries, and tools unless absolutely necessary. 
- **Familiar Stack Only:** Stick with React, Tailwind, Firebase — avoid deep rabbit holes with unfamiliar tools. 

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (with Vite), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for animations)  
- **Backend/Services:** Firestore
- **Deployment:** Vercel  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub  
- **Design Tools:** Figma for layout mockups and previews
