# About Me

My journey into tech wasn’t linear — but it was inevitable.

I started dabbling with code back in the day, just messing around with HTML and scripts for fun. Then life took a turn — I joined the U.S. military, where I spent years maintaining helicopters and learning the kind of discipline you can’t fake. That experience shaped who I am: focused, adaptable, and never one to back down from a challenge.

Now, I’m a full-stack developer with a couple years of hands-on experience and a deep drive to build things that matter. I’ve honed my skills across both frontend and backend — from crafting responsive interfaces in React and CSS, to deploying robust Node.js apps with MongoDB, Nginx, and PM2. I’m comfortable at every layer of the stack, and I treat clean code, meaningful UX, and secure deployments with the same care I brought to every mission in uniform.

But behind the code, I’m a father, a gamer, a boxing fan, and a lifelong learner who genuinely loves technology. I’m family-oriented and purpose-driven — everything I do in tech is guided by a desire to create positive change and leave things better than I found them.

I’m a 100% disabled veteran with something to prove — not to anyone else, but to myself. I’ve already fought to rebuild my life. Now I’m fighting to help others through software.

Let’s build something that matters.
