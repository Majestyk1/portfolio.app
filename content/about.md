# About Me

I’m a passionate full-stack web developer dedicated to building useful, user-friendly applications. As a 100% disabled U.S. veteran, I bring discipline and resilience to every project. I recently graduated from the TripleTen coding bootcamp, where I honed my skills by creating real-world web applications. My mission is to turn ideas into elegant, accessible web solutions that make a positive impact.

With hands-on experience in React, Firebase, and mobile-first design, I’ve built full-stack apps like **Green Findr** (a Google Maps-integrated park locator), an **HVAC CMS** tool for field technicians, and **RememberMe AI**, a personalized assistant created during a hackathon. These projects reflect my ability to move fast, solve real problems, and create clean, responsive interfaces that work well on any device.

Before tech, I served in the U.S. Army as a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter maintainer in the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. That high-stakes environment demanded precision, accountability, and teamwork — qualities I now bring into every codebase and collaboration.

I’m currently upskilling in AI automation workflows and cloud certifications (AWS and CompTIA Security+), and I’m always seeking ways to level up both technically and professionally. Whether I’m writing code, helping teammates, or learning something new, I’m driven by the same values: clarity, growth, and impact.
