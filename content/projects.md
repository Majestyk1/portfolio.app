### Green Findr
**Role:** Full-Stack Developer  
**Tech:** React, Tailwind CSS, Firebase (Firestore/Auth), Google Maps API  
**Description:** A sustainable business directory website to help users locate eco-friendly shops and services. I designed the UI with a dark theme and built interactive components in React.

### HVAC Service Portal
**Role:** Full-Stack Developer  
**Tech:** React, Tailwind CSS, Firebase (Firestore), Node.js  
**Description:** A custom-built content management system (CMS) designed for HVAC technicians to log, manage, and track service calls, parts inventory, and customer information. I created a streamlined dashboard UI with React and Tailwind, and used Firebase Firestore to manage backend data.

### RememberMe AI
**Role:** Hackathon Developer  
**Tech:** React, Python (Flask), OpenAI API, Tailwind CSS  
**Description:** A 48-hour hackathon project that created a personalized AI companion for memory recall and journaling. Users could input important moments, facts, or goals — and the app would use OpenAI to summarize, recall, and reframe them in helpful ways. I led the UI development and handled integration with the backend Flask API. This project demonstrates my ability to work fast, collaborate under pressure, and integrate AI services into full-stack applications.

**Role:** Developer & Designer  
**Tech:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Netlify  
**Description:** A single-page developer portfolio to showcase who I am, what I’ve built, and where I’m going. Built from scratch using Vite and Tailwind, the site includes polished animations, mobile-first design, and a clean dark theme. The content is dynamically sourced from Markdown files for easy updates and iteration. This project reflects my attention to detail, visual design principles, and end-to-end project execution.

### Additional Projects (Optional Highlights)
- **AI Pokémon Generator:** A fun prototype using OpenAI’s API to generate new Pokémon based on user prompts. Great for experimenting with prompt engineering, data display, and user input validation.
- **Spotify Clone Challenge:** A 1-hour UI challenge where I recreated Spotify’s landing page using mock data, React, and Tailwind. This tested my speed, layout precision, and creative use of utility classes under time pressure.
